- Interoperability and compatibility requirements
- Trust management and governance requirements
- Implementation architecture guidelines
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Performance and scalability requirements

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- User interface design specifications
- Hardware platform requirements
- Third-party integration specifications (unless normatively referenced)
- Business logic implementation details
- Organization-specific deployment procedures

- **Client Device:** A hardware/software platform executing a NORC client implementation with device-specific cryptographic key material
- **Organization Authority:** The administrative entity responsible for user/device enrollment and local policy management

- **External Integrator:** A third-party system interfacing via approved extension or gateway APIs without violating mandatory security constraints

### 2.2 Technical Definitions

**R-2.2.1** The following technical terms SHALL have the meanings specified:

- **Adjacent-Major Compatibility (AMC):** A versioning constraint permitting interoperability across exactly one major version gap (N â†” N+1) but prohibiting compatibility across two or more major version gaps
- **Trust Level:** A hierarchical security classification defining the strength of cryptographic verification and operational constraints between federation partners
- **Device Identity:** A unique cryptographic identity bound to a specific client device, comprising public/private key pairs and associated certificates
- **Session Key:** An ephemeral cryptographic key used for a specific communication session with automatic rotation and forward secrecy properties
- **Federation Link:** A persistent, mutually authenticated communication channel between two federation servers
- **Trust Certificate:** A cryptographically signed assertion establishing trust relationships and permitted operations between federation servers

### 2.3 Trust Level Hierarchy

**R-2.3.1** The protocol SHALL support the following trust levels in ascending order of security requirements (the "Untrusted" level represents an explicit prohibition state and is not a negotiated operational level):

1. **Untrusted:** No established trust relationship; communication prohibited
2. **Basic:** Domain verification sufficient; standard business relationships
3. **Verified:** Organizational verification required; enhanced assurance relationships
4. **Classified:** Government/enterprise PKI required; security-cleared environments
5. **NATO:** NATO-level security clearance; international security cooperation

**R-2.3.2** Each trust level SHALL impose progressively stricter requirements for:
- Certificate authority validation
- Key algorithm and strength requirements
- Background verification procedures
- Compliance standard adherence
- Audit trail granularity

# NORC – NavaTron Open Real-time Communication Protocol

Open-source | Secure | Federated | Real-time

⸻

## 🎯 Goals
	•	Provide a secure, real-time communication protocol for chat, calls, and media.
	•	Support federation between trusted organizations.
	•	Ensure end-to-end encryption with strong device-level key management.
	•	Be open and extensible like Matrix/XMPP, but simpler and security-first.

⸻

## 🏗️ Architecture Layers
	1.	NORC-C (Client ↔ Server)
	•	Handles registration, authentication, and real-time messaging.
	•	Every client device holds a private key.
	•	Server stores public keys per device (one user = many devices).
	•	When sending, client encrypts with the public keys of all recipient devices.
	•	Server only relays messages; cannot decrypt content.
	2.	NORC-F (Server ↔ Server)
	•	Supports federated trust between organizations.
	•	Servers exchange signed messages using inter-server public keys.
	•	Relays encrypted payloads without visibility of content.
	•	Trust can be bilateral or multi-lateral (federated mesh).
	3.	NORC-T (Trust Setup)
	•	Defines how two servers establish federation trust.
	•	Uses mutual key exchange (e.g. X.509 or PGP-style certificates).
	•	Supports revocation, rotation, and audit trails.

⸻

## 🔑 Security Model
	•	End-to-end encryption: Only recipient device(s) can decrypt.
	•	Forward secrecy: Each session uses ephemeral keys.
	•	Metadata minimization: Servers store delivery info only, not content.
	•	Federation trust: Formalized via NORC-T handshake with revocable certs.

## 📊 Comparison with Existing Protocols

Feature	NORC	Matrix	XMPP	Signal
End-to-End Encryption	✅ Native, per-device	Optional	Extension	✅
Federation	✅ Built-in trust model	✅ Open federation	✅ Open federation	❌ Centralized
Key Management	✅ Device-level public keys	User keys + device	Limited	Device keys
Server Visibility	❌ Relay only	Partial metadata	High	❌
Target Audience	Gov/Enterprise, NATO, critical comms	Broad developer base	Legacy IM	Consumer security

## 🚀 Why NORC?
	•	Security classification support (Private → NATO Restricted).
	•	Auto-archiving for compliance (configurable by classification).
	•	Lightweight, modular, and open — easier than Matrix, more modern than XMPP.
	•	Designed for governments and regulated industries but open to all.

⸻

## 📜 License
	•	Apache 2.0 – Open, permissive, with patent protection.
	•	Future option: dual-license extensions for compliance/certification.

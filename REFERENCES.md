# Citation & Usage Notes
These references inform rationale sections in the NORC specification, security model, and trust establishment documents. Where a mechanism mirrors prior art (e.g., transcript binding, ratchets, hybrid key derivation), the intent is to leverage existing cryptanalysis rather than invent novel primitives.
